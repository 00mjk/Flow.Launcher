Flow's roots came from a rebrand of the JJW24/Wox fork and WoX.
A big thank you and all credits to Bao, the author of WoX,
and its contrbutors for all the amazing work.
The JJW24/Wox fork started adding new changes on top of
main WoX repo's code base from release v1.3.524.
Flow is a continuation of the work from JJW24/Wox
